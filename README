AUTHENTICATED HTTP REQUEST - POSTEROUS
by: Julio Terra || julioterra.com/journal

Sample code used to download data from posterous.com. Code connects to posterous using their API version 2. It uses Java's IO and Net libraries.

The class URLAuthReader encapsulates all the functionality that enables the reading of data from posterous. This functionality is provided via three static functions:

(1) authenticated_http_request: opens connection to posterous server and makes the appropriate request, with user name and password.

(2) read_http_request: reads data that was sent in response to the request and returns that data.

(3) authenticated_http_request_read: this joins the previous two functions together. It makes the http request and then returns a String with the results.
